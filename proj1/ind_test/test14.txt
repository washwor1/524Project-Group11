the stranger , pricking up his ears at the sound of Alleyne 's words . `` Never have I heard music that was so sweet to mine ear . Come , Watkin lad , throw the bales over Laura 's back ! My heart was nigh broke , for it seemed that I had left all that was English behind me , and that I would never set eyes upon Norwich market square again . '' He was a tall , lusty , middle-aged man with a ruddy face , a brown forked beard shot with gray , and a broad Flanders hat set at the back of his head . His servant , as tall as himself , but gaunt and raw-boned , had swung the bales on the back of one mule , while the merchant mounted upon the other and rode to join the party . It was easy to see , as he approached , from the quality of his dress and the richness of his trappings , that he was a man of some wealth and position . `` Sir knight , '' said he , `` my name is David Micheldene , and I am a burgher and alderman of the good town of Norwich , where I live five doors from the church of Our Lady , as all men know on the banks of Yare . I have here my bales of cloth which I carry to Cahors -- woe worth the day that ever I started on such an errand ! I crave your gracious protection upon the way for me , my servant , and my mercery ; for I have already had many perilous passages , and have now learned that Roger Club-foot , the robber-knight of Quercy , is out upon the road in front of me . I hereby agree to give you one rose-noble if you bring me safe to the inn of the 'Angel ' in Cahors , the same to be repaid to me or my heirs if any harm come to me or my goods . '' `` By Saint Paul ! '' answered Sir Nigel , `` I should be a sorry knight if I ask pay for standing by a countryman in a strange land . You may ride with me and welcome , Master Micheldene , and your varlet may follow with my archers . '' `` God 's benison upon thy bounty ! '' cried the stranger . `` Should you come to Norwich you may have cause to remember that you have been of service to Alderman Micheldene . It is not very far to Cahors , for surely I see the cathedral towers against the sky-line ; but I have heard much of this Roger Clubfoot , and the more I hear the less do I wish to look upon his face . Oh , but I am sick and weary of it all , and I would give half that I am worth to see my good dame sitting in peace beside me , and to hear the bells of Norwich town . '' `` Your words are strange to me , '' quoth Sir Nigel , `` for you have the appearance of a stout man , and I see that you wear a sword by your side . '' `` Yet it is not my trade , '' answered the merchant . `` I doubt not that if I set you down in my shop at Norwich you might scarce tell fustian from falding , and know little difference between the velvet of Genoa and the three-piled cloth of Bruges . There you might well turn to me for help . But here on a lone roadside , with thick woods and robber-knights , I turn to you , for it is the business to which you have been reared . '' `` There is sooth in what you say , Master Micheldene , '' said Sir Nigel , '' and I trust that we may come upon this Roger Clubfoot , for I have heard that he is a very stout and skilful soldier , and a man from whom much honor is to be gained . '' `` He is a bloody robber , '' said the trader , curtly , `` and I wish I saw him kicking at the end of a halter . '' `` It is such men as he , '' Sir Nigel remarked , `` who give the true knight honorable deeds to do , whereby he may advance himself . '' `` It is such men as he , '' retorted Micheldene , `` who are like rats in a wheat-rick or moths in a woolfels , a harm and a hindrance to all peaceful and honest men . '' `` Yet , if the dangers of the road weigh so heavily upon you , master alderman , it is a great marvel to me that you should venture so far from home . '' `` And sometimes , sir knight , it is a marvel to myself . But I am a man who may grutch and grumble , but when I have set my face to do a thing I will not turn my back upon it until it be done . There is one , Francois Villet , at Cahors , who will send me wine-casks for my cloth-bales , so to Cahors I will go , though all the robber-knights of Christendom were to line the roads like yonder poplars . '' `` Stoutly spoken , master alderman ! But how have you fared hitherto ? '' `` As a lamb fares in a land of wolves . Five times we have had to beg and pray ere we could pass . Twice I have paid toll to the wardens of the road . Three times we have had to draw
