not a prisoner , but a guest . What time have you , captain ? ” “ Five minutes after two. ” Lupin consulted his watch , then looked at the clock that was attached to the wall of the cabin . “ Five minutes past two is right . How long will it take you to reach Southampton ? ” “ Nine hours , easy going. ” “ Make it eleven .
