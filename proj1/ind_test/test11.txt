for fear of losing us . “ Quite right , my dear friend , ” I said . “ After such a run , our victim must be out of wind . We will catch him now. ” I examined the surroundings with the idea of proceeding alone in the arrest of the fugitive , in order to recover my papers , concerning which the authorities would doubtless ask many disagreeable questions . Then I returned to my companions , and said : “ It is all quite easy . You , Massol , take your place at the left ; you , Delivet , at the right . From there , you can observe the entire posterior line of the bush , and he can not escape without you seeing him , except by that ravine , and I shall watch it . If he does not come out voluntarily , I will enter and drive him out toward one or the other of you . You have simply to wait . Ah ! I forgot : in case I need you , a pistol shot. ” Massol and Delivet walked away to their respective posts . As soon as they had disappeared , I entered the grove with the greatest precaution so as to be neither seen nor heard . I encountered dense thickets , through which narrow paths had been cut , but the overhanging boughs compelled me to adopt a stooping posture . One of these paths led to a clearing in which I found footsteps upon the wet grass . I followed them ; they led me to the foot of a mound which was surmounted by a deserted , dilapidated hovel . “ He must be there , ” I said to myself . “ It is a well-chosen retreat. ” I crept cautiously to the side of the building . A slight noise informed me that he was there ; and , then , through an opening , I saw him . His back was turned toward me . In two bounds , I was upon him . He tried to fire a revolver that he held in his hand . But he had no time . I threw him to the ground , in such a manner that his arms were beneath him , twisted and helpless , whilst I held him down with my knee on his breast . “ Listen , my boy , ” I whispered in his ear . “ I am Arsène Lupin . You are to deliver over to me , immediately and gracefully , my pocketbook and the lady ’ s jewels , and , in return therefore , I will save you from the police and enroll you amongst my friends . One word : yes or no ? ” “ Yes , ” he murmured . “ Very good . Your escape , this morning , was well planned . I congratulate you.
