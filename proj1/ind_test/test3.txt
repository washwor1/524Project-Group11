. I wish the spirits were more farcical than they are . That they should make more jokes and better ones , would be my suggestion . For almost all the spiritualism of our time , in so far as it is new , is solemn and sad . Some Pagan gods were lawless , and some Christian saints were a little too serious ; but the spirits of modern spiritualism are both lawless and serious -- a disgusting combination . The specially contemporary spirits are not only devils , they are blue devils . This is , first and last , the real value of Christmas ; in so far as the mythology remains at all it is a kind of happy mythology . Personally , of course , I believe in Santa Claus ; but it is the season of forgiveness , and I will forgive others for not doing so . But if there is anyone who does not comprehend the defect in our world which I am civilising , I should recommend him , for instance , to read a story by Mr. Henry James , called “ The Turn of the Screw. ” It is one of the most powerful things ever written , and it is one of the things about which I doubt most whether it ought ever to have been written at all . It describes two innocent children gradually growing at once omniscient and half-witted under the influence of the foul ghosts of a groom and a governess . As I say , I doubt whether Mr. Henry James ought to have published it ( no , it is not indecent , do not buy it ; it is a spiritual matter ) , but I think the question so doubtful that I will give that truly great man a chance . I will approve the thing as well as admire it if he will write another tale just as powerful about two children and Santa Claus . If he will not , or can not , then the conclusion is clear ; we can deal strongly with gloomy mystery , but not with happy mystery ; we are not rationalists , but diabolists . ..... I have thought vaguely of all this staring at a great red fire that stands up in the room like a great red angel . But , perhaps , you have never heard of a red angel . But you have heard of a blue devil . That is exactly what I mean . XVIII . The Tower I have been standing where everybody has stood , opposite the great Belfry Tower of Bruges , and thinking , as every one has thought ( though not , perhaps , said ) , that it is built in defiance of all decencies of architecture . It is made in deliberate disproportion to achieve the one startling effect of height . It is a church on stilts . But this sort of sublime deformity is characteristic of the whole fancy and energy of these Flemish cities . Flanders has the flattest and most prosaic landscapes , but the most violent and extravagant of buildings . Here Nature is tame ; it is civilisation that is untamable . Here the fields are as flat as a paved square ; but , on the other hand , the streets and roofs are as uproarious as a forest in a great wind . The waters of wood and meadow slide as smoothly and meekly as if they were in the London water-pipes . But the parish pump is carved with all the creatures out of the wilderness . Part of this is true , of course , of all art . We talk of wild animals , but the wildest animal is man . There are sounds in music that are more ancient and awful than the cry of the strangest beast at night . And so also there are buildings that are shapeless in their strength , seeming to lift themselves slowly like monsters from the primal mire , and there are spires that seem to fly up suddenly like a startled bird . ..... This savagery even in stone is the expression of the special spirit in humanity . All the beasts of the field are respectable ; it is only man who has broken loose . All animals are domestic animals ; only man is ever undomestic . All animals are tame animals ; it is only we who are wild . And doubtless , also , while this queer energy is common to all human art , it is also generally characteristic of Christian art among the arts of the world . This is what people really mean when they say that Christianity is barbaric , and arose in ignorance . As a matter of historic fact , it didn ’ t ; it arose in the most equably civilised period the world has ever seen . But it is true that there is something in it that breaks the outline of perfect and conventional beauty , something that dots with anger the blind eyes of the Apollo and lashes to a cavalry charge the horses of the Elgin Marbles . Christianity is savage , in the sense that it is primeval ; there is in it a touch of the nigger hymn . I remember a debate in which I had praised militant music in ritual , and some one asked me if I could imagine Christ walking down the street before a brass band . I said I could imagine it with the greatest ease ; for Christ definitely approved a natural noisiness at a great moment . When the street children shouted too loud , certain priggish disciples did begin to rebuke them in the name of good taste . He said : “ If these were silent the very stones would cry
