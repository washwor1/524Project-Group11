the crime . Now I am assured that this is not so . At the same time , there is much that is unexplained , and I should strongly recommend that you ask Mr. Douglas to tell us his own story. ” Mrs. Douglas gave a cry of astonishment at Holmes ’ s words . The detectives and I must have echoed it , when we were aware of a man who seemed to have emerged from the wall , who advanced now from the gloom of the corner in which he had appeared . Mrs. Douglas turned , and in an instant her arms were round him . Barker had seized his outstretched hand . “ It ’ s best this way , Jack , ” his wife repeated ; “ I am sure that it is best. ” “ Indeed , yes , Mr. Douglas , ” said Sherlock Holmes , “ I am sure that you will find it best. ” The man stood blinking at us with the dazed look of one who comes from the dark into the light . It was a remarkable face , bold gray eyes , a strong , short-clipped , grizzled moustache , a square , projecting chin , and a humorous mouth . He took a good look at us all , and then to my amazement he advanced to me and handed me a bundle of paper . “ I ’ ve heard of you , ” said he in a voice which was not quite English and not quite American , but was altogether mellow and pleasing . “ You are the historian of this bunch . Well , Dr. Watson , you ’ ve never had such a story as that pass through your hands before , and I ’ ll lay my last dollar on that . Tell it your own way ; but there are the facts , and you can ’ t miss the public so long as you have those . I ’ ve been cooped up two days , and I ’ ve spent the daylight hours—as much daylight as I could get in that rat trap—in putting the thing into words . You ’ re welcome to them—you and your public . There ’ s the story of the Valley of Fear. ” “ That ’ s the past , Mr. Douglas , ” said Sherlock Holmes quietly . “ What we desire now is to hear your story of the present. ” “ You ’ ll have it , sir , ” said Douglas . “ May I smoke as I talk ? Well , thank you , Mr. Holmes . You ’ re a smoker yourself , if I remember right , and you ’ ll guess what it is to be sitting for two days with tobacco in your pocket and afraid that the smell will give you away. ” He leaned against the mantelpiece and sucked at the cigar which Holmes had handed him . “ I ’ ve heard of you , Mr. Holmes . I never guessed that I should meet you . But before you are through with that , ” he nodded at my papers , “ you will say I ’ ve brought you something fresh. ” Inspector MacDonald had been staring at the newcomer with the greatest amazement . “ Well , this fairly beats me ! ” he cried at last . “ If you are Mr. John Douglas of Birlstone Manor , then whose death have we been investigating for these two days , and where in the world have you sprung from now ? You seemed to me to come out of the floor like a jack-in-a-box. ” “ Ah , Mr. Mac , ” said Holmes , shaking a reproving forefinger , “ you would not read that excellent local compilation which described the concealment of King Charles . People did not hide in those days without excellent hiding places , and the hiding place that has once been used may be again . I had persuaded myself that we should find Mr. Douglas under this roof. ” “ And how long have you been playing this trick upon us , Mr. Holmes ? ” said the inspector angrily . “ How long have you allowed us to waste ourselves upon a search that you knew to be an absurd one ? ” “ Not one instant , my dear Mr. Mac . Only last night did I form my views of the case . As they could not be put to the proof until this evening , I invited you and your colleague to take a holiday for the day . Pray what more could I do ? When I found the suit of clothes in the moat , it at once became apparent to me that the body we had found could not have been the body of Mr. John Douglas at all , but must be that of the bicyclist from Tunbridge Wells . No other conclusion was possible . Therefore I had to determine where Mr. John Douglas himself could be , and the balance of probability was that with the connivance of his wife and his friend he was concealed in a house which had such conveniences for a fugitive , and awaiting quieter times when he could make his final escape. ” “ Well , you figured it out about right , ” said Douglas approvingly . “ I thought I ’ d dodge your British law ; for I was not sure how I stood under it , and also I saw my chance to throw these hounds once for all off my track . Mind you , from first to last I have done nothing to be ashamed of , and nothing that I would not do again ; but you ’ ll judge that for yourselves when
