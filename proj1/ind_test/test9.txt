have failed to discover the perpetrator . This time we want the criminal ... and quickly ! '' `` A difficult job , chief . '' `` It 's got to be done . Listen to me , Ganimard . According to what the maid says , Jenny Saphir led a very regular life . For a month past she was in the habit of frequently receiving visits , on her return from the music-hall , that is to say , at about half-past ten , from a man who would stay until midnight or so . 'He 's a society man , ' Jenny Saphir used to say , 'and he wants to marry me . ' This society man took every precaution to avoid being seen , such as turning up his coat-collar and lowering the brim of his hat when he passed the porter 's box . And Jenny Saphir always made a point of sending away her maid , even before he came . This is the man whom we have to find . '' `` Has he left no traces ? '' `` None at all . It is obvious that we have to deal with a very clever scoundrel , who prepared his crime beforehand and committed it with every possible chance of escaping unpunished . His arrest would be a great feather in our cap . I rely on you , Ganimard . '' `` Ah , you rely on me , chief ? '' replied the inspector . `` Well , we shall see ... we shall see .... I do n't say no .... Only .... '' He seemed in a very nervous condition , and his agitation struck M. Dudouis . `` Only , '' continued Ganimard , `` only I swear ... do you hear , chief ? I swear .... '' '' What do you swear ? '' `` Nothing .... We shall see , chief ... we shall see .... '' Ganimard did not finish his sentence until he was outside , alone . And he finished it aloud , stamping his foot , in a tone of the most violent anger : '' Only , I swear to Heaven that the arrest shall be effected by my own means , without my employing a single one of the clues with which that villain has supplied me . Ah , no ! Ah , no ! ... '' Railing against Lupin , furious at being mixed up in this business and resolved , nevertheless , to get to the bottom of it , he wandered aimlessly about the streets . His brain was seething with irritation ; and he tried to adjust his ideas a little and to discover , among the chaotic facts , some trifling detail , unperceived by all , unsuspected by Lupin himself , that might lead him to success . He lunched hurriedly at a bar , resumed his stroll and suddenly stopped , petrified , astounded and confused . He was walking under the gateway of the very house in the Rue de Surène to which Lupin had enticed him a few hours earlier ! A force stronger than his own will was drawing him there once more . The solution of the problem lay there . There and there alone were all the elements of the truth . Do and say what he would , Lupin's assertions were so precise , his calculations so accurate , that , worried to the innermost recesses of his being by so prodigious a display of perspicacity , he could not do other than take up the work at the point where his enemy had left it . Abandoning all further resistance , he climbed the three flights of stairs . The door of the flat was open . No one had touched the exhibits . He put them in his pocket and walked away . From that moment , he reasoned and acted , so to speak , mechanically , under the influence of the master whom he could not choose but obey . Admitting that the unknown person whom he was seeking lived in the neighbourhood of the Pont-Neuf , it became necessary to discover , somewhere between that bridge and the Rue de Berne , the first-class confectioner 's shop , open in the evenings , at which the cakes were bought . This did not take long to find . A pastry-cook near the Gare Saint-Lazare showed him some little cardboard boxes , identical in material and shape with the one in Ganimard 's possession . Moreover , one of the shop-girls remembered having served , on the previous evening , a gentleman whose face was almost concealed in the collar of his fur coat , but whose eyeglass she had happened to notice . `` That 's one clue checked , '' thought the inspector . `` Our man wears an eyeglass . '' He next collected the pieces of the racing-paper and showed them to a newsvendor , who easily recognized the _Turf Illustré_ . Ganimard at once went to the offices of the _Turf_ and asked to see the list of subscribers . Going through the list , he jotted down the names and addresses of all those who lived anywhere near the Pont-Neuf and principally -- because Lupin had said so -- those on the left bank of the river . He then went back to the Criminal Investigation Department , took half a dozen men and packed them off with the necessary instructions . At seven o'clock in the evening , the last of these men returned and brought good news with him . A certain M. Prévailles , a subscriber to the _Turf_ , occupied an entresol flat on the Quai des Augustins . On the previous evening , he left his place , wearing a fur coat , took his letters and his
