autograph letter of thanks from the French President and the Order of the Legion of Honour . Each of these would furnish a narrative , but on the whole I am of opinion that none of them unites so many singular points of interest as the episode of Yoxley Old Place , which includes not only the lamentable death of young Willoughby Smith , but also those subsequent developments which threw so curious a light upon the causes of the crime . It was a wild , tempestuous night , towards the close of November . Holmes and I sat together in silence all the evening , he engaged with a powerful lens deciphering the remains of the original inscription upon a palimpsest , I deep in a recent treatise upon surgery . Outside the wind howled down Baker Street , while the rain beat fiercely against the windows . It was strange there , in the very depths of the town , with ten miles of man ’ s handiwork on every side of us , to feel the iron grip of Nature , and to be conscious that to the huge elemental forces all London was no more than the molehills that dot the fields . I walked to the window , and looked out on the deserted street . The occasional lamps gleamed on the expanse of muddy road and shining pavement . A single cab was splashing its way from the Oxford Street end . “ Well , Watson , it ’ s as well we have not to turn out to-night , ” said Holmes , laying aside his lens and rolling up the palimpsest . “ I ’ ve done enough for one sitting . It is trying work for the eyes . So far as I can make out , it is nothing more exciting than an Abbey ’ s accounts dating from the second half of the fifteenth century . Halloa ! halloa ! halloa ! What ’ s this ? ” Amid the droning of the wind there had come the stamping of a horse ’ s hoofs , and the long grind of a wheel as it rasped against the curb . The cab which I had seen had pulled up at our door . “ What can he want ? ” I ejaculated , as a man stepped out of it . “ Want ? He wants us . And we , my poor Watson , want overcoats and cravats and goloshes , and every aid that man ever invented to fight the weather . Wait a bit , though ! There ’ s the cab off again ! There ’ s hope yet . He ’ d have kept it if he had wanted us to come . Run down , my dear fellow , and open the door , for all virtuous folk have been long in bed. ” When the light of the hall lamp fell upon our midnight visitor , I had no difficulty in recognizing him . It was young Stanley Hopkins , a promising detective , in whose career Holmes had several times shown a very practical interest . “ Is he in ? ” he asked , eagerly . “ Come up , my dear sir , ” said Holmes ’ s voice from above . “ I hope you have no designs upon us such a night as this. ” The detective mounted the stairs , and our lamp gleamed upon his shining waterproof . I helped him out of it , while Holmes knocked a blaze out of the logs in the grate . “ Now , my dear Hopkins , draw up and warm your toes , ” said he . “ Here ’ s a cigar , and the doctor has a prescription containing hot water and a lemon , which is good medicine on a night like this . It must be something important which has brought you out in such a gale. ” “ It is indeed , Mr. Holmes . I ’ ve had a bustling afternoon , I promise you . Did you see anything of the Yoxley case in the latest editions ? ” “ I ’ ve seen nothing later than the fifteenth century to-day. ” “ Well , it was only a paragraph , and all wrong at that , so you have not missed anything . I haven ’ t let the grass grow under my feet . It ’ s down in Kent , seven miles from Chatham and three from the railway line . I was wired for at 3:15 , reached Yoxley Old Place at 5 , conducted my investigation , was back at Charing Cross by the last train , and straight to you by cab. ” “ Which means , I suppose , that you are not quite clear about your case ? ” “ It means that I can make neither head nor tail of it . So far as I can see , it is just as tangled a business as ever I handled , and yet at first it seemed so simple that one couldn ’ t go wrong . There ’ s no motive , Mr. Holmes . That ’ s what bothers me—I can ’ t put my hand on a motive . Here ’ s a man dead—there ’ s no denying that—but , so far as I can see , no reason on earth why anyone should wish him harm. ” Holmes lit his cigar and leaned back in his chair . “ Let us hear about it , ” said he . “ I ’ ve got my facts pretty clear , ” said Stanley Hopkins . “ All I want now is to know what they all mean . The story , so far as I can make it out , is like this . Some
