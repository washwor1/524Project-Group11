a bitter face , and James Barker 's nostrils curled ; Wilson began to giggle faintly , and the Provost of West Kensington followed in a smothered way . But the big blue eyes of Adam Wayne never changed , and he called out in an odd , boyish voice down the hall -- '' I bring homage to my King . I bring him the only thing I have -- my sword . '' And with a great gesture he flung it down on the ground , and knelt on one knee behind it . There was a dead silence . `` I beg your pardon , '' said the King , blankly . `` You speak well , sire , '' said Adam Wayne , `` as you ever speak , when you say that my love is not less than the love of these . Small would it be if it were not more . For I am the heir of your scheme -- the child of the great Charter . I stand here for the rights the Charter gave me , and I swear , by your sacred crown , that where I stand , I stand fast . '' [ Illustration : `` I BRING HOMAGE TO MY KING . '' ] The eyes of all five men stood out of their heads . Then Buck said , in his jolly , jarring voice : `` Is the whole world mad ? '' The King sprang to his feet , and his eyes blazed . `` Yes , '' he cried , in a voice of exultation , `` the whole world is mad , but Adam Wayne and me . It is true as death what I told you long ago , James Barker , seriousness sends men mad . You are mad , because you care for politics , as mad as a man who collects tram tickets . Buck is mad , because he cares for money , as mad as a man who lives on opium . Wilson is mad , because he thinks himself right , as mad as a man who thinks himself God Almighty . The Provost of West Kensington is mad , because he thinks he is respectable , as mad as a man who thinks he is a chicken . All men are mad but the humorist , who cares for nothing and possesses everything . I thought that there was only one humorist in England . Fools ! -- dolts ! -- open your cows ' eyes ; there are two ! In Notting Hill -- in that unpromising elevation -- there has been born an artist ! You thought to spoil my joke , and bully me out of it , by becoming more and more modern , more and more practical , more and more bustling and rational . Oh , what a feast it was to answer you by becoming more and more august , more and more gracious , more and more ancient and mellow ! But this lad has seen how to bowl me out . He has answered me back , vaunt for vaunt , rhetoric for rhetoric . He has lifted the only shield I can not break , the shield of an impenetrable pomposity . Listen to him . You have come , my Lord , about Pump Street ? '' `` About the city of Notting Hill , '' answered Wayne , proudly , `` of which Pump Street is a living and rejoicing part . '' `` Not a very large part , '' said Barker , contemptuously . `` That which is large enough for the rich to covet , '' said Wayne , drawing up his head , `` is large enough for the poor to defend . '' The King slapped both his legs , and waved his feet for a second in the air . `` Every respectable person in Notting Hill , '' cut in Buck , with his cold , coarse voice , `` is for us and against you . I have plenty of friends in Notting Hill . '' `` Your friends are those who have taken your gold for other men's hearthstones , my Lord Buck , '' said Provost Wayne . `` I can well believe they are your friends . '' `` They 've never sold dirty toys , anyhow , '' said Buck , laughing shortly . `` They 've sold dirtier things , '' said Wayne , calmly : `` they have sold themselves . '' `` It 's no good , my Buckling , '' said the King , rolling about on his chair . `` You ca n't cope with this chivalrous eloquence . You ca n't cope with an artist . You ca n't cope with the humorist of Notting Hill . Oh , _Nunc dimittis_ -- that I have lived to see this day ! Provost Wayne , you stand firm ? '' `` Let them wait and see , '' said Wayne . `` If I stood firm before , do you think I shall weaken now that I have seen the face of the King ? For I fight for something greater , if greater there can be , than the hearthstones of my people and the Lordship of the Lion . I fight for your royal vision , for the great dream you dreamt of the League of the Free Cities . You have given me this liberty . If I had been a beggar and you had flung me a coin , if I had been a peasant in a dance and you had flung me a favour , do you think I would have let it be taken by any ruffians on the road ? This leadership and liberty of Notting Hill is a gift from your Majesty , and if it is
