us , '' he said to the officer . And , going up to Lupin : '' The papers . '' The tone was no longer the same . It was now the harsh and imperious tone of the master who is at home and addressing an inferior . . . and such an inferior ! A rogue , an adventurer of the worst type , before whom he had been obliged to humiliate himself ! `` The papers , '' he repeated . Lupin was not put out of countenance . He said , quite calmly : '' They are in Veldenz Castle . '' `` We are in the out-buildings of the castle . Those are the ruins of Veldenz , over there . '' `` The papers are in the ruins . '' `` Let us go to them . Show me the way . '' Lupin did not budge . `` Well ? '' `` Well , Sire , it is not as simple as you think . It takes some time to bring into play the elements which are needed to open that hiding-place . '' `` How long do you want ? '' `` Twenty-four hours . '' An angry movement , quickly suppressed : '' Oh , there was no question of that between us ! '' `` Nothing was specified , neither that nor the little trip which Your Imperial Majesty made me take in the charge of half a dozen of your body-guard . I am to hand over the papers , that is all . '' `` And I am not to give you your liberty until you do hand over those papers . '' `` It is a question of confidence , Sire . I should have considered myself quite as much bound to produce the papers if I had been free on leaving prison ; and Your Imperial Majesty may be sure that I should not have walked off with them . The only difference is that they would now be in your possession . For we have lost a day , Sire . And a day , in this business . . . is a day too much . . . . Only , there it is , you should have had confidence . '' The Emperor gazed with a certain amazement at that outcast , that vagabond , who seemed vexed that any one should doubt his word . He did not reply , but rang the bell : '' The officer on duty , '' he commanded . Count von Waldemar appeared , looking very white . `` Ah , it 's you , Waldemar ? So you 're all right again ? '' `` At your service , Sire . '' `` Take five men with you . . . the same men , as you 're sure of them . Do n't leave this . . . gentleman until to-morrow morning . '' He looked at his watch . `` Until to-morrow morning at ten o'clock . No , I will give him till twelve . You will go wherever he thinks fit to go , you will do whatever he tells you to do . In short , you are at his disposal . At twelve o'clock , I will join you . If , at the last stroke of twelve , he has not handed me the bundle of letters , you will put him back in your car and , without losing a second , take him straight to the Sant√© Prison . '' `` If he tries to escape . . . . '' `` Take your own course . '' He went out . Lupin helped himself to a cigar from the table and threw himself into an easy chair : '' Good ! I just love that way of going to work . It is frank and explicit . '' The count had brought in his men . He said to Lupin : '' March ! '' Lupin lit his cigar and did not move . `` Bind his hands , '' said the count . And , when the order was executed , he repeated : '' Now then , march ! '' `` No . '' `` What do you mean by no ? '' `` I 'm wondering . '' `` What about ? '' `` Where on earth that hiding-place can be ! '' The count gave a start and Lupin chuckled : '' For the best part of the story is that I have not the remotest idea where that famous hiding-place is nor how to set about discovering it . What do you say to that , my dear Waldemar , eh ? Funny , is n't it ? . . . Not the very remotest idea ! . . . '' CHAPTER XII THE EMPEROR 'S LETTERS The ruins of Veldenz are well known to all who visit the banks of the Rhine and the Moselle . They comprise the remains of the old feudal castle , built in 1377 by the Archbishop of Fistingen , an enormous dungeon-keep , gutted by Turenne 's troops , and the walls , left standing in their entirety , of a large Renascence palace , in which the grand-dukes of Zweibrucken lived for three centuries . It was this palace that was sacked by Hermann II . 's rebellious subjects . The empty windows display two hundred yawning cavities on the four frontages . All the wainscoting , the hangings and most of the furniture were burnt . You walk on the scorched girders of the floors ; and the sky can be seen at intervals through the ruined ceilings . Lupin , accompanied by his escort , went over the whole building in two hours ' time : '' I am very pleased with you , my dear count . I do
