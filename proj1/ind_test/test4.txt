futile to argue that man is small compared to the cosmos ; for man was always small compared to the nearest tree . But Herbert Spencer , in his headlong imperialism , would insist that we had in some way been conquered and annexed by the astronomical universe . He spoke about men and their ideals exactly as the most insolent Unionist talks about the Irish and their ideals . He turned mankind into a small nationality . And his evil influence can be seen even in the most spirited and honourable of later scientific authors ; notably in the early romances of Mr. H.G . Wells . Many moralists have in an exaggerated way represented the earth as wicked . But Mr. Wells and his school made the heavens wicked . We should lift up our eyes to the stars from whence would come our ruin . But the expansion of which I speak was much more evil than all this . I have remarked that the materialist , like the madman , is in prison ; in the prison of one thought . These people seemed to think it singularly inspiring to keep on saying that the prison was very large . The size of this scientific universe gave one no novelty , no relief . The cosmos went on for ever , but not in its wildest constellation could there be anything really interesting ; anything , for instance , such as forgiveness or free will . The grandeur or infinity of the secret of its cosmos added nothing to it . It was like telling a prisoner in Reading gaol that he would be glad to hear that the gaol now covered half the county . The warder would have nothing to show the man except more and more long corridors of stone lit by ghastly lights and empty of all that is human . So these expanders of the universe had nothing to show us except more and more infinite corridors of space lit by ghastly suns and empty of all that is divine . In fairyland there had been a real law ; a law that could be broken , for the definition of a law is something that can be broken . But the machinery of this cosmic prison was something that could not be broken ; for we ourselves were only a part of its machinery . We were either unable to do things or we were destined to do them . The idea of the mystical condition quite disappeared ; one can neither have the firmness of keeping laws nor the fun of breaking them . The largeness of this universe had nothing of that freshness and airy outbreak which we have praised in the universe of the poet . This modern universe is literally an empire ; that is , it is vast , but it is not free . One went into larger and larger windowless rooms , rooms
