. The three mystical virtues which Christianity has not adopted , but invented , are faith , hope , and charity . Now much easy and foolish Christian rhetoric could easily be poured out upon those three words , but I desire to confine myself to the two facts which are evident about them . The first evident fact ( in marked contrast to the delusion of the dancing pagan ) —the first evident fact , I say , is that the pagan virtues , such as justice and temperance , are the sad virtues , and that the mystical virtues of faith , hope , and charity are the gay and exuberant virtues . And the second evident fact , which is even more evident , is the fact that the pagan virtues are the reasonable virtues , and that the Christian virtues of faith , hope , and charity are in their essence as unreasonable as they can be . As the word “ unreasonable ” is open to misunderstanding , the matter may be more accurately put by saying that each one of these Christian or mystical virtues involves a paradox in its own nature , and that this is not true of any of the typically pagan or rationalist virtues . Justice consists in finding out a certain thing due to a certain man and giving it to him . Temperance consists in finding out the proper limit of a particular indulgence and adhering to that . But charity means pardoning what is unpardonable , or it is no virtue at all . Hope means hoping when things are hopeless , or it is no virtue at all . And faith means believing the incredible , or it is no virtue at all . It is somewhat amusing , indeed , to notice the difference between the fate of these three paradoxes in the fashion of the modern mind . Charity is a fashionable virtue in our time ; it is lit up by the gigantic firelight of Dickens . Hope is a fashionable virtue to-day ; our attention has been arrested for it by the sudden and silver trumpet of Stevenson . But faith is unfashionable , and it is customary on every side to cast against it the fact that it is a paradox . Everybody mockingly repeats the famous childish definition that faith is “ the power of believing that which we know to be untrue. ” Yet it is not one atom more paradoxical than hope or charity . Charity is the power of defending that which we know to be indefensible . Hope is the power of being cheerful in circumstances which we know to be desperate . It is true that there is a state of hope which belongs to bright prospects and the morning ; but that is not the virtue of hope . The virtue of hope exists only in earthquake and , eclipse . It is true that there is a thing crudely called charity , which means charity to the deserving poor ; but charity to the deserving is not charity at all , but justice . It is the undeserving who require it , and the ideal either does not exist at all , or exists wholly for them . For practical purposes it is at the hopeless moment that we require the hopeful man , and the virtue either does not exist at all , or begins to exist at that moment . Exactly at the instant when hope ceases to be reasonable it begins to be useful . Now the old pagan world went perfectly straightforward until it discovered that going straightforward is an enormous mistake . It was nobly and beautifully reasonable , and discovered in its death-pang this lasting and valuable truth , a heritage for the ages , that reasonableness will not do . The pagan age was truly an Eden or golden age , in this essential sense , that it is not to be recovered . And it is not to be recovered in this sense again that , while we are certainly jollier than the pagans , and much more right than the pagans , there is not one of us who can , by the utmost stretch of energy , be so sensible as the pagans . That naked innocence of the intellect can not be recovered by any man after Christianity ; and for this excellent reason , that every man after Christianity knows it to be misleading . Let me take an example , the first that occurs to the mind , of this impossible plainness in the pagan point of view . The greatest tribute to Christianity in the modern world is Tennyson ’ s “ Ulysses. ” The poet reads into the story of Ulysses the conception of an incurable desire to wander . But the real Ulysses does not desire to wander at all . He desires to get home . He displays his heroic and unconquerable qualities in resisting the misfortunes which baulk him ; but that is all . There is no love of adventure for its own sake ; that is a Christian product . There is no love of Penelope for her own sake ; that is a Christian product . Everything in that old world would appear to have been clean and obvious . A good man was a good man ; a bad man was a bad man . For this reason they had no charity ; for charity is a reverent agnosticism towards the complexity of the soul . For this reason they had no such thing as the art of fiction , the novel ; for the novel is a creation of the mystical idea of charity . For them a pleasant landscape was pleasant , and an unpleasant landscape unpleasant . Hence they had no idea of romance ; for romance consists
