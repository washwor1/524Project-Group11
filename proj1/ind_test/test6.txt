shoulder at the line of railway on his right . Then he turned on Syme a face transfigured to that of a fiend , and began to fight as if with twenty weapons . The attack came so fast and furious , that the one shining sword seemed a shower of shining arrows . Syme had no chance to look at the railway ; but also he had no need . He could guess the reason of the Marquis ’ s sudden madness of battle—the Paris train was in sight . But the Marquis ’ s morbid energy over-reached itself . Twice Syme , parrying , knocked his opponent ’ s point far out of the fighting circle ; and the third time his _riposte_ was so rapid , that there was no doubt about the hit this time .

For one moment the heaven of Syme again grew black with supernatural terrors . Surely the man had a charmed life . But this new spiritual dread was a more awful thing than had been the mere spiritual topsy-turvydom symbolised by the paralytic who pursued him . The Professor was only a goblin ; this man was a devil—perhaps he was the Devil ! Anyhow , this was certain , that three times had a human sword been driven into him and
