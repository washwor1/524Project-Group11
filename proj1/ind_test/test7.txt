, Alexandria ) , it is stated that , after the defeat of Veridovix by G. Titullius Sabinus , the chief of the Caleti was brought before Cæsar and that , for his ransom , he revealed the secret of the Needle— The Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte , between Charles the Simple and Rollo , the chief of the Norse barbarians , gives Rollo ’ s name followed by all his titles , among which we read that of Master of the Secret of the Needle . The _Saxon Chronicle_ ( Gibson ’ s edition , page 134 ) , speaking of William the Conqueror , says that the staff of his banner ended in a steel point pierced with an eye , like a needle . In a rather ambiguous phrase in her examination , Joan of Arc admits that she has still a great secret to tell the King of France . To which her judges reply , “ Yes , we know of what you speak ; and that , Joan , is why you shall die the death. ” Philippe de Comines mentions it in connection with Louis XI. , and , later , Sully in connection with Henry IV . : “ By the virtue of the Needle ! ” the good king sometimes swears . Between these two , Francis I. , in a speech addressed to the notables of the Havre , in 1520 , uttered this phrase , which has been handed down in the diary of a Honfleur burgess ; “ The Kings of France carry secrets that often decide the conduct of affairs and the fate of towns. ” All these quotations , all the stories relating to the Iron Mask , the captain of the guards and his descendant , I have found to-day in a pamphlet written by this same descendant and published in the month of June , 1815 , just before or just after the battle of Waterloo , in a period , therefore , of great upheavals , in which the revelations which it contained were likely to pass unperceived . What is the value of this pamphlet ? Nothing , you will tell me , and we must attach no credit to it . And this is the impression which I myself would have carried away , if it had not occurred to me to open Cæsar ’ s _Commentaries_ at the chapter given . What was my astonishment when I came upon the phrase quoted in the little book before me ! And it was the same thing with the Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte , with the _Saxon Chronicle_ , with the examination of Joan of Arc , in short , with all that I have been able to verify up to the present . Lastly , there is an even more precise fact related by the author of the pamphlet of 1815 . During the French campaign , he being then an officer under Napoleon , his horse dropped dead , one evening , and he rang at the door of a castle where he was received by an old knight of St. Louis . And , in the course of conversation with the old man , he learnt that this castle , standing on the bank of the Creuse , was called the Château de l ’ Aiguille , that it had been built and christened by Louis XIV. , and that , by his express order , it was adorned with turrets and with a spire which represented the Needle . As its date it bore , it must still bear , the figure 1680 . 1680 ! One year after the publication of the book and the imprisonment of the Iron Mask ! Everything was now explained : Louis XIV. , foreseeing that the secret might be noised abroad , had built and named that castle so as to offer the quidnuncs a natural explanation of the ancient mystery . The Hollow Needle ! A castle with pointed bell-turrets standing on the bank of the Creuse and belonging to the King . People would at once think that they had the key to the riddle and all enquiries would cease . The calculation was just , seeing that , more than two centuries later , M. Beautrelet fell into the trap . And this , Sir , is what I was leading up to in writing this letter . If Lupin , under the name of Anfredi , rented from M. Valméras the Château de l ’ Aiguille on the bank of the Creuse ; if , admitting the success of the inevitable investigations of M. Beautrelet , he lodged his two prisoners there , it was because he admitted the success of the inevitable researches made by M. Beautrelet and because , with the object of obtaining the peace for which he had asked , he laid for M. Beautrelet precisely what we may call the historic trap of Louis XIV . And hence we come to this undeniable conclusion , that he , Lupin , by his unaided lights , without possessing any other facts than those which we possess , managed by means of the witchcraft of a really extraordinary genius , to decipher the undecipherable document ; and that he , Lupin , the last heir of the Kings of France , knows the royal mystery of the Hollow Needle ! Here ended the letter . But , for some minutes , from the passage that referred to the Château de l ’ Aiguille onward , it was not Beautrelet ’ s but another voice that read it aloud . Realizing his defeat , crushed under the weight of his humiliation , Isidore had dropped the newspaper and sunk into his chair , with his face buried in his hands . Panting , shaken with excitement by this incredible story , the crowd had come gradually nearer
