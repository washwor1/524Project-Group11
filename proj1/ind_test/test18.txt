But what a caravan ! When the head of it had reached the base of the mountains , the rear was not yet visible on the horizon . Right across the enormous plain stretched the straggling array , waggons and carts , men on horseback , and men on foot . Innumerable women who staggered along under burdens , and children who toddled beside the waggons or peeped out from under the white coverings .
